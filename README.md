# Neukölln Gentrification Map Frontend

This project is for collecting and visualising data about displacement and urban transformation in Neukölln, Berlin during the Covid-19 crisis. Many of the tenants of commercial property in Neukölln are financially precarious, and the neighbourhood has been under great strain in terms of rent increase for years. We see the effects of how the city government itself drives gentrification, with the disproportionate use of infrastructure: the Broadway Neukölln plan and upgrades on Karl-Marx-Strasse bicycle paths show that when enough middle class people move in, the city sees the value in investing in the neighbourhood. Our neoliberal government prioritises increasing the tax base over protecting the livelihoods and meeting the basic needs of long term Neukölln residents. The city and the property investors would be happy to kick the current residents out if they could replace them with people who make more profit.

The policies created to deal with the Covid-19 crises have caused temporary shutdown of places that occupy commercial real estate. This includes places like: salons, cafes, electronics stores, discount shops, community spaces, and more. For some occupants of these spaces, the financial burden of paying the commercial lease will be insurmountable. For banks and investors who want to get their hands on Neukölln will be happy to see tenants evicted in order to fill the space ith someone paying higher prices. Places that close in Neukölln during the Covid-19 crises may be replaced with companies with little community connection, and at higher rents.

Keeping a record of how our neighbourhood is permanently changed by the Covid-19 crises, and on in to the future will be a resource for activist, to strengthen the message of antigentrfication organising.
